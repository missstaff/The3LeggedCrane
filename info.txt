//FROM BREW PAGE

The majority of our ales and lagers begin in the same fashion as most traditional European beers. We start with the finest malt and hops directly fired, open fermented and then the yeast is top cropped. We then transfer the nearly fermented beer into a closed vessel to allow the active yeast to naturally carbonate. We then give our fine beers time to condition, mature and develop into the best malted beverage it can be.
